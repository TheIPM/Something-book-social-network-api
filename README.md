In order to use this application, you need to run an npm install to install the correct dependenceies. Once they are installed you can then open the integrated terminal and type "node server.js" which will initialize the API so it's up and running on http://localhost:3001. Then using the correct API endpoints, and a tool like postman or insomnia a user will be able to interact with the API.
